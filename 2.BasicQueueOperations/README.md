#Basic Queue

##In this application you have an integer N representing the number of elements to enqueue (add), an integer S representing the number of elements to dequeue (remove) from the queue
##and an integer X, an element that you should look for in the queue. 
##If it is, print true on the console. If it’s not print the smallest element currently present in the queue. If there are no elements in the sequence, print 0 on the console.
